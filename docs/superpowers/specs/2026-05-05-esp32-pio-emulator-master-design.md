## 1. Mission

`esp32-pio-emulator` is a **behavioral simulator for ESP32 firmware that runs natively on a developer's machine**. It compiles the user's unmodified Arduino-framework sketch against host-side fakes of the ESP32 hardware abstraction layer, then exposes two test surfaces:

- **In-process C++ surface (Unity, via PlatformIO `native` env):** fast unit tests against the fake runtime — assert on GPIO levels, serial output, peripheral interactions, virtual time.
- **Out-of-process Python surface (`pytest-embedded` service plugin):** scenario tests that drive the simulated device from outside, sharing the standard `dut.expect()` API used against Wokwi, QEMU, and real hardware.

The simulator does **not** emulate the Tensilica/RISC-V ISA. It runs the user's code as native host code with the hardware-facing layer substituted. Test feedback is in milliseconds and the implementation stays tractable.

## 2. Value proposition

ESP32 developers today have these test paths, each with sharp tradeoffs:

| Path | Speed | Coverage | OSS / local |
|---|---|---|---|
| Real hardware | Slow (flash + manual setup) | Full | Yes, but requires the board |
| Wokwi | Fast | Broad | No — closed core, hosted |
| QEMU (Espressif fork) | Medium | Partial peripherals; awkward harness | Yes |
| PlatformIO `native` + hand-written mocks | Fast | Only what you mocked | Yes |

`esp32-pio-emulator` targets the **fast + broad + OSS + local** quadrant the existing ecosystem doesn't cover. The success criterion: a developer can do **TDD on ESP32 code** — write a failing test, write the sketch, see it pass, in under one second per cycle, without ever flashing a board.

## 3. Non-goals

- **Cycle-accurate ISA emulation.** That's QEMU's job. We compile native.
- **Replacing real-hardware QA.** Final validation happens on real boards.
- **Replacing Wokwi.** Wokwi is excellent for visual prototyping; we are a test target, not a circuit playground.
- **Multi-MCU support beyond ESP32 in v1.** Primary target is **ESP32-S3** (matches the test-candidate reference projects). Classic ESP32, S2, C3, C6 are best-effort: most peripherals share the arduino-esp32 unified API surface, but variant-specific differences (USB-OTG, RGB-LED on GPIO48, ADC pin counts, RMT channel counts) get nailed down at T2 entry. A future ESP-IDF platform adapter is out of scope for v1; the architecture leaves room for it.
- **GUI.** Headless-only, CI-first.

```

Three layers of code, two test surfaces. The layers communicate through narrow interfaces; the surfaces share the same core state.

### 4.1 Layer responsibilities

- **Sketch** — completely unchanged from real ESP32 code. The user does not write `#ifdef` branches.
- **Platform adapter (`platforms/arduino-esp32/`)** — header-compatible drop-in replacements for the Arduino-ESP32 framework's headers. Every public function and class is implemented as a thin forwarder into the core engine. This is the seam that lets a future `platforms/esp-idf/` plug in.
- **Core engine (`core/`)** — language-and-framework-neutral simulation primitives. No knowledge of `Wire` or `WiFi`; only `I2CBus`, `Network`. The platform adapter translates framework concepts into core concepts.
- **Harnesses (`harness/unity/`, `harness/pytest_pio_emulator/`)** — read core state and let test authors assert on it. The Unity harness is a C++ library linked into the test binary. The pytest-embedded harness is a Python plugin that spawns the test binary as a subprocess and talks to it over a control channel.

### 4.2 Why two surfaces and not one

They serve genuinely different test layers, established as best practice across the ESP32 ecosystem (`pytest-embedded` exists for this reason):

| Layer | Surface | Example test |
|---|---|---|
| Pure logic unit test | Unity in-process | "the CSV parser handles empty fields correctly" |
| Peripheral interaction unit test | Unity in-process | "after `setup()`, GPIO 2 is HIGH within 500 ms" |
| Scenario / system test | pytest-embedded out-of-process | "device boots → connects to WiFi → fetches HTTP → publishes MQTT → recovers from disconnect" |

The two surfaces are not redundant. The Unity surface is fastest and supports rich C++ assertions about internal state. The pytest-embedded surface gives you Python's ecosystem (`pytest-httpserver`, async, fixtures, parametrization) and writes the same test code that runs on real hardware.

## 5. Core abstractions

These are the contracts the entire system depends on. Each is implemented in `core/` and exported through `core/include/esp32sim/`.

### 5.1 `VirtualClock`

Singleton. Owns simulated time. Tests advance the clock explicitly; `delay(ms)` does not sleep — it advances the clock.

```cpp
class VirtualClock {
public:
  uint64_t now_us() const;
  void advance(uint64_t us);                          // runs all due callbacks
  ScheduleHandle schedule_at(uint64_t us, Callback);  // alarms, ISRs
  void cancel(ScheduleHandle);
};
```

### 5.2 `EventLog`

Append-only log of every observable action. Powers assertions and the pytest-embedded surface.

```cpp
struct Event {
  uint64_t timestamp_us;
  EventKind kind;       // GPIO_WRITE, UART_TX, I2C_TXN, WIFI_STATE, ...
  std::variant<...> payload;
};

class EventLog {
public:
  void emit(Event);
  std::vector<Event> since(uint64_t timestamp_us) const;
  // ...iterator, filter-by-kind helpers...
};
```

### 5.3 `PinRegistry`

Maps GPIO pin number → current digital level + mode + attached peripheral (e.g., a fake button driving the pin from outside).

### 5.4 `I2CBus`, `SPIBus`

Bus simulators. Devices register at construction time; transactions go through bus arbitration.

```cpp
class I2CBus {
public:
  void attach(uint8_t addr, std::shared_ptr<I2CDevice>);
  Result write(uint8_t addr, const uint8_t* data, size_t len);
  Result read(uint8_t addr, uint8_t* buf, size_t len);
};

class I2CDevice {
public:
  virtual Result on_write(const uint8_t* data, size_t len) = 0;
  virtual Result on_read(uint8_t* buf, size_t len) = 0;
};
```

### 5.5 `UartChannel`

Per-UART pair of buffers. Sketch writes go to TX; tests can read from TX. Tests can inject into RX; sketch reads consume from RX.

### 5.6 `PeripheralRegistry`

Lookup table for fake devices created by tests. `ESP32Sim::attachI2C(0x76, FakeBMP280{...})` registers a device; the I2C bus consults this registry during `Wire.requestFrom(0x76, ...)`.

### 5.7 `NetworkShim` (T3+)

Abstracts the WiFi/network surface. Two implementations evaluated at T3 entry:
- **Python-mock-server-backed** — sketch network calls forward to Python harness, which routes to mock servers (`pytest-httpserver`, embedded MQTT broker).
- **Real-LWIP-on-host** — sketch links against real LWIP compiled for host; test fixtures provide a tap device or in-process socket pairs.

The choice is captured as a Tier 3 ADR.

### 5.8 `RtosShim` (T4+)

Cooperative pseudo-scheduler that simulates FreeRTOS task scheduling without real preemption. `xTaskCreate`, `xQueueSend`, `xSemaphoreTake` work but tasks yield deterministically at API boundaries. Decision deferred — alternative is FreeRTOS POSIX port.

### 5.9 `PlatformAdapter` interface

The contract every platform implementation must fulfill. `platforms/arduino-esp32/` is the v1 implementation. A future `platforms/esp-idf/` would implement the same contract.

```cpp
struct PlatformAdapter {
  // Lifecycle
  virtual void on_test_setup() = 0;     // resets engine state
  virtual void run_setup() = 0;         // calls user's setup()
  virtual void run_loop_iteration() = 0;// calls user's loop() once
  virtual void on_test_teardown() = 0;
};
```

The user's `setup()`/`loop()` (or `app_main()` for ESP-IDF) are invoked through this contract; tests never call them directly.

```

The split between `src/core/`, `src/platforms/`, `src/harness/`, and `peripherals/` is the architectural seam. Anything that knows about `Wire` lives in `src/platforms/`; anything that knows about I2C-as-a-protocol lives in `src/core/`; anything that knows about a specific I2C chip lives in `peripherals/`; anything that helps you test lives in `src/harness/` (in-process Unity API) or `harness/pytest_pio_emulator/` (out-of-process Python plugin, T2+).

**Why `src/` and `include/` at root, not `core/include/` etc.?** PlatformIO library convention is one `src/` and one `include/` at the project root. Consumers `lib_deps` us; PIO compiles `src/` and adds `include/` to the include path. The fake `Arduino.h` *must* be at `include/Arduino.h` so consumer sketches' `#include <Arduino.h>` resolves to our fake — there's no other way to honor "compile the unmodified sketch." Logical separation between core/platforms/harness is preserved via subdirectories within `src/`. (Earlier draft of this spec proposed `core/include/` etc.; that layout doesn't work with PIO library packaging — see master spec changelog v0.3.)

## 7. Tier roadmap

| Tier | Codename | Surfaces | Deliverable | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T0** | Skeleton | — | Repo bootstrap, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, Diátaxis docs scaffold, PlatformIO project, GH Actions CI | `pio test -e native` runs a trivial pass test |
| **T1** | GPIO TDD | Unity | `pinMode`, `digital{Read,Write}`, `Serial`, `millis`, `micros`, `delay`, virtual clock, `ESP32Sim::*` assertion API | Test-drive an LED blinker, a serial echo, a button debouncer — all without hardware |
| **T2** | Sensor TDD | Unity + pytest-embedded plugin α | I2C, SPI, ADC, PWM (`ledc`), interrupts, hardware timers, first stateful peripheral fakes (BMP280, MCP23017) | BMP280 logger sketch tested via Unity unit tests AND a pytest-embedded scenario test |
| **T3** | Networked | pytest-embedded leads | WiFi (connect/RSSI/disconnect), `WiFiClient`/`WiFiServer`, HTTP, MQTT, NTP. Decision point on networking impl recorded as ADR. | Sketch connects to "WiFi", fetches HTTP from a test fixture, publishes to MQTT — fully offline in CI |
| **T4** | Full chip | Both | LittleFS, SPIFFS, NVS/Preferences, deep-sleep, RMT, dual-core/FreeRTOS scheduling, BT Classic, BLE | Reference project: temperature logger w/ deep-sleep + BLE provisioning + WiFi MQTT, fully tested offline |

Each tier is its own brainstorm → spec → plan → execute cycle. Per-tier specs live alongside this one.

## 8. Quality bar

Per AGENTS.md (`Per-step verify-and-document`, `Documentation currency`):

- Every implementation step ends with: (1) verification command run + green, (2) every doc the change affects updated in the same commit series, (3) commit + push.
- No tier ships until its reference example passes in CI.
- Spec drift policy: if reality contradicts spec, commit a spec update *first*, then adapt code.
- Small, reviewable commits. One concept per commit.
- TDD by default for original code; the framework's fakes have unit tests.

## 9. Documentation strategy

[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) — four docs categories × two audiences:

| Audience | Tutorials | How-to | Reference | Explanation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **User** (test author) | "Your first GPIO test in 5 min" (T1) | "Fake an I2C sensor" (T2), "Test a WiFi sketch" (T3) | API reference for `ESP32Sim::*` and pytest fixtures | "Why virtual time", "Fake vs mock vs emulate" |
| **Dev** (framework contributor) | "Set up your dev environment" (T0) | "Add a new peripheral fake" (T2), "Add a platform adapter" (T2) | Internal architecture, ABI contracts | Design rationale, link to ADRs |

Documentation is created or updated in the **same commit** as the code change. `docs/README.md` is the navigation map and is updated whenever a new doc lands.

## 10. Meta-testing strategy

The framework itself is tested:
- **`test/core/`** — unit tests for `VirtualClock`, `EventLog`, `I2CBus`, `SPIBus`, `UartChannel` against direct C++ usage (no sketch).
- **`test/platforms/arduino-esp32/`** — adapter conformance tests that exercise the fake `Arduino.h` from a tiny sketch and verify the resulting events.
- **`test/peripherals/`** (T2+) — each fake peripheral has datasheet-conformance tests (e.g., "BMP280 fake responds to register 0xD0 with chip ID 0x58").
- **`examples/`** — end-to-end smoke tests run in CI on every PR. An example failing means a tier regression.

CI runs the full matrix on Linux and macOS (ESP32 dev population is overwhelmingly on these).

## 11. Decisions register

### Resolved

| # | Decision | Resolution | Captured in |
|---|---|---|---|
| D5 | ESP32 variant priority for v1 | **ESP32-S3 primary**, classic ESP32 / S2 / C3 / C6 best-effort. Variant-specific peripheral differences land at T2 entry. | [ADR-0001](../../decisions/0001-esp32-s3-primary-target.md) |
| D6 | Code formatter / linter choice | clang-format LLVM style, 100-col, indent=4. Python: `ruff` (faster than black + flake8 combo, single tool). | T0 implementation (see [T0 spec](2026-05-05-tier-0-skeleton-design.md)) |
| D8 | Position vs `ArduinoFake` (the FakeIt-based mocking lib used in test-candidate repos) | **We do not ship it as a dependency.** Behavioral fakes are our recommended path; users who want call-recording mocks can add ArduinoFake themselves. We document the conceptual difference but do not test or promise interop. | [ADR-0003](../../decisions/0003-supersede-arduinofake-coexistence.md) (supersedes [ADR-0002](../../decisions/0002-arduinofake-coexistence.md)) |
| D9 | C++ standard | `gnu++17` — modern, matches the user's mini-fork project, broadly supported by host compilers. | T0 `platformio.ini` |
| D10 | Pre-commit hook framework | Use `pre-commit` (pre-commit.com) with `clang-format`, `trailing-whitespace`, `end-of-file-fixer`, `check-yaml`, `ruff` (T2+) hooks. | T0 implementation |
| D11 | Dockerfile for CI | Not in T0. GH Actions runners are sufficient. Revisit only if CI flakiness emerges. | This spec |
| D12 | OS support matrix | Ubuntu 22.04+, macOS 13+ documented as **supported** for contributors and users. **CI matrix runs Ubuntu only in v0.x** — free GitHub Actions macOS runners queued 40+ min during T0 setup without starting (Ubuntu finished in 25s). macOS will be re-added to CI when T1 introduces any platform-sensitive code, or earlier if needed. Windows via WSL2 documented as "should work, untested." | This spec; CI matrix |

### Deferred

| # | Decision | Defer until | Capture as |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | T3 networking impl: Python mock servers vs real-LWIP-on-host | Tier 3 entry | ADR |
| D2 | T4 RTOS impl: cooperative pseudo-scheduler vs FreeRTOS POSIX port | Tier 4 entry | ADR |
| D3 | Project license confirmation (MIT assumed) | Pre-public-release | `LICENSE` |
| D4 | PlatformIO library registry namespace (`esp32-pio-emulator`) | Pre-public-release | `library.json` |
| D7 | T4 BLE simulation depth: stub-level vs behavioral (with Python BLE peer fixture) | Tier 4 entry | ADR |

## 11.5 Reference projects (test candidates)

Two real ESP32 projects from the user's portfolio serve as ongoing acceptance proof. As each tier ships, more of these projects' code becomes runnable in the simulator without modification:

| Repo | Purpose | What it exercises |
|---|---|---|
| [`fresh-fx59/iot-yc-water-the-flowers-mini`](https://github.com/fresh-fx59/iot-yc-water-the-flowers-mini) | Single-zone watering controller (mini fork). ESP32-S3, gnu++17. | I2C (DS3231 RTC), ADC (moisture), GPIO (overflow), WiFi, HTTPS (Telegram bot, Prometheus push), LittleFS (web UI), NVS, OTA. |
| [`fresh-fx59/iot-yc-water-the-flowers`](https://github.com/fresh-fx59/iot-yc-water-the-flowers) | Multi-tray watering controller with self-learning. ESP32-S3, gnu++11. | Same as mini + WS2812B (NeoPixel/RMT), state machines, WebSocket support, larger LittleFS web UI. |

Both already use `[env:native]` with Unity + ArduinoFake; their existing native tests (~73KB, 20+ test cases) are the floor — our framework should make these tests *easier to write* and *more behaviorally faithful*, not replace them. Per-tier acceptance:

- **T1** — extract the GPIO/Serial/timing-only logic from these projects (e.g., the overflow-sensor polling loop, the watering scheduler tick) and exercise it as an end-to-end T1 example.
- **T2** — fake the DS3231 RTC and the moisture-ADC pin; run the watering controller's state machine in sim; assert phase transitions match the existing `test_state_machine.cpp` results.
- **T3** — drive the Telegram notifier and Prometheus pusher against `pytest-httpserver` fixtures; assert the right HTTPS calls happen at the right times.
- **T4** — boot the mini-fork sketch end-to-end, including LittleFS web UI serving and OTA flow, using only the simulator.

These are honest acceptance milestones because both projects are real, used, and maintained. If a tier's milestones pass against them, the tier ships.

## 12. Glossary

- **Behavioral simulator** — software that mimics observable hardware behavior without emulating CPU instructions. Contrast with **emulator** (e.g., QEMU) which executes the target ISA.
- **HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)** — the layer of API calls (`digitalWrite`, `Wire.beginTransmission`, etc.) that we intercept.
- **Sketch** — Arduino-framework user code with `setup()` and `loop()`, possibly across multiple `.cpp` files.
- **Dut (Device Under Test)** — pytest-embedded's standard interface for talking to the device (real or simulated).
- **Tier** — a phased capability set (T0 → T4); each tier ships standalone before the next begins.
- **Surface** — a test API exposed to users. We have two: in-process Unity and out-of-process pytest-embedded.
- **Fake** vs **mock** — a *fake* implements working behavior (a real-ish BMP280 that returns sensible data); a *mock* records calls for verification (`ArduinoFake`-style).

## 13. Changelog

| Date | Version | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-05 | v0.1 | Initial draft after brainstorming + OSS research |
| 2026-05-05 | v0.2 | Added §11.5 reference projects (test candidates from user's portfolio). Resolved D5/D6/D8/D9/D10/D11/D12 — promoted to "Resolved" subtable. Added new D8 (ArduinoFake coexistence), D9 (C++17), D10 (pre-commit), D11 (Dockerfile), D12 (OS support). ESP32-S3 set as primary target in §3. |
| 2026-05-05 | v0.2.1 | D12 amended during T0 implementation — CI matrix narrowed to Ubuntu-only because macOS-13 free runners were queueing 40+ minutes. macOS remains a supported OS for contributors; CI coverage returns when there is platform-sensitive code to test. |
| 2026-05-05 | v0.3   | §6 repo layout restructured for PlatformIO library-packaging compatibility. The original layout (`core/include/`, `core/src/`, `platforms/arduino-esp32/include/`, etc.) doesn't work because PIO expects one `src/` and one `include/` at the project root. New layout uses top-level `src/` and `include/` with subdirectories preserving the architectural seam. Critically, the fake `Arduino.h` lives at `include/Arduino.h` — without this, consumer sketches' `#include <Arduino.h>` cannot resolve to our fake, and the "unmodified sketch" promise breaks. Discovered while planning T1 implementation; spec drift committed before T1 plan is written per AGENTS.md doctrine. |
